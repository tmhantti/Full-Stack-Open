# Redux-Anecdotes-CI
My own CI pipeline for exercises 11.20 & 11.21 (Full Stack Open)  
The app is based on [Anecdote list project](https://github.com/tmhantti/Full-Stack-Open/FullStackOpen-6/tree/main/anecdotes-redux).  
<p>Following changes were to the original project:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Mock database is created with Express instead of JSON-server</li>
<li>Project is built using Webpack instead of React-build</li>
<li>Several unit tests were implemented with jest</li>
</ul>

App is deployed with Fly.io. NOTE: Fly.io deployment may take several hours due to Fly.io memory capacity. One can try to restart the deployment process. However, the deployed app can be accessed [here](https://wild-fire-5805.fly.dev/).
